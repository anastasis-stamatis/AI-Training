# AI - Neural Networks and Machine Learning

I first got into data science by following online courses on how to build neural networks. Their concept was very similar to the Finite Element Method I had studied during my student years, and I was excited to see how similar principles could be applied to help machines learn and make decisions.

I created some examples for fun, to understand neural networks on a deeper level. I chose to showcase two:


## Self-Driving Car
I worked on this project following the instructions on the Artificial Intelligence A-Z Course (link) by SuperDataScience. My goal was to understand the fundamentals of:

- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Q-learning
- Exploration-Exploitation tradeoff
- Experience Replay

The environment was created using kivy and the AI was created with pytorch.<br>
When I was working on this, I was adding comments where necessary and made modifications to the code, in order to better understand the way Reinforcement Learning works and optimize the learning and reward processes.


## A3C Algorithm Implementation
And that's when I learned about the A3C!
After experimenting online, I used a medium article as a base to develop an A3C algorithm for the OpenAI Gym RAM input challenges.

The first run was based on https://medium.com/tensorflow/deep-reinforcement-learning-playing-cartpole-through-asynchronous-advantage-actor-critic-a3c-7eab2eea5296
And was changed significantly, including improvements and additional implementation from https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras
