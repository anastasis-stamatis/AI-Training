    "I worked on this project following the instructions on the Artificial Intelligence A-Z Course (link) by SuperDataScience. My goal was to understand the fundamentals of kivy, Reinforcement Learning, including Deep Q-Learning, Exploration-Exploitation tradeoff and Experience Replay. I have added comments where necessary and made modifications to the code, in order to better understand the way Reinforcement Learning works and optimize the learning and reward processes."
